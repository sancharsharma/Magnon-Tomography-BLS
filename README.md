This is the code for an upcoming publication on the tomography of magnons using Brillouin light scattering. Feel free to contact me on sancharsharma@gmail.com for any issues/comments/questions related to this code, like if there is a bug or if the code is too difficult to understand or if you have suggestions of improvements, etc. 

The file 'Data_Gen.py' generates the relevant data, i.e. the wigner functions of the target and reconstructed outputs as in Figs. 3-6 in the paper. The data is stored in .hf format. The relevant .hf files are also uploaded where the structure should be straightforward to understand.

To generate the paper plots, the .hf file should be used in 'Plots.py'.
